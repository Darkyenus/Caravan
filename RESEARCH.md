## City economics
- City/town has:
    - Population that grows when needs are met and/or the city is rich
        - Population has needs and takes goods from the stockpile
        - Things such as food, water, clothing, armor, weapons, tools, fuel wood for their homes, timber and stone for construction...
        - Type and amount of goods that are taken from the stockpile changes depending on the city wealth
            - Poor city will not want spices, while rich city will demand luxury clothing
        - People leave or die (food + water) when the needs are not fulfilled
    - Money - collective wealth of a city, static quantity
    - Supply
        - Constant stream of goods and produce, based on the city's active production
    - Stockpile
        - List of goods that are available for trade
        - Production takes resources from here and puts results here (in one atomic step)
        - Caravans purchase goods from here and sell goods from here
        - Goods that are in a stockpile for long and in large quantities drop in price over time
        - Conversely, goods that are missing from the stockpile (and there is demand from them!) rise in price
    - Production
        - Describes what are the people in the city doing
        - Each "production" is a single activity converting something (input goods or natural resources) into something else (output goods)
        - Each production type requires a certain amount of people and has certain yields
        - Each production enterprise traces its supply and demand - and changes the production when it is no longer profitable (randomly over time)
    - External factors
        - Some production types will show up on the overworld map as decoration - fields, pastures, etc.
        - A wealthy city may want to hire an army and build roads to neighboring towns

#### Unimplemented for now
- Horses - would imply other animals as well
- Livestock
- Peat
- Fertilizer? (can use wool, peat, limestone...)

#### Additional notes
- Common low-value goods are traded mostly locally.
- Road, bridge, mountain pass tolls - bribing helps
- Only luxury goods worth transporting a long distance
- Ships are cheaper, but more dangerous, due to weather and pirates
- Roads speed up the movement considerably
- Banking, loans and investments?
